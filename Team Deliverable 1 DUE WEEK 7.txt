The first team deliverable is worth 3 points and is due in Week 7.  <-- 2/22 - 2/28
Teams will have short (5-10 minute) meetings with the TA where you will
demonstrate that:  ***I don't know if we have to make this appointment -Sy


• your team has registered your project on github  
**TEAM CHECK**

• everyone in the group has used a calendaring system of their choice to create
a .ics event file and has looked at the content of that file with a text editor
such (such as vim or textedit). “Reverse engineering” .ics files can offer
significant insight.

• your team has functioning code, no matter how minimal: You must
demonstrate code that generates a .ics file for a simple, single occurrence
event such as: Study for exam, 1pm-2pm HST, 12 May 2016, in Hamilton
Library. You must then demonstrate that the calendar program of your
choice (say, google calendar) successfully reads and processes the .ics files
you generate. The code could be a simple as print statements, but for that
single event, but it must generate an .ics file that is readable by a calendar
project.

• In the real-world, your code would be embedded in a larger calendaring
system, so don’t worry much about a user interface. In fact, to create .ics
files your user interface can be command line or simple drop-down menus.
