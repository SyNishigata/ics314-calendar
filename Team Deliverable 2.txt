The second team deliverable is worth 5 points and is due in Week 9.
Teams will have short (5-10 minute) meetings with the TA where you will
demonstrate that:

• system allows the use of the “geographic position” field described in section
3.8.1.6 of the RFC. Events are not required to use the field, but if the
information is provided by the user, your system must support it by putting
it into the event file.

• your systems must also implement the “classification” field as described in
section 3.8.1.3 of the RFC. Events are not required to use the field, but if the
information is provided by the user, your system must support it by putting
it into the event file

• Your team has a systematic way of testing the code as you are writing it. I
suggest, among other things, using JUnit to develop and execute test cases as
you are developing code (http://www.junit.org/node/49)
The third team deliverable is worth 5 points and is due in Week 12.

EXTRA: 
• Your team has implemented at least one form of user-input verification
